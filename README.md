# 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriela Galetti Rusca (@GabiGalettiRusca)

🌿 I'm a Forest Engineer, Rural & Environmental Consultant, and currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Environmental Sciences at UFSCar – focusing on **landscape management**, **climate resilience**, and **regenerative agriculture**.

🔬 I’m passionate about science-based solutions for sustainable land use, biodiversity conservation, and nature-based strategies to restore ecosystems and rural economies. I work at the intersection of research, consulting, and policy — integrating GIS, environmental modeling, and socioecological planning.

💡 I'm also a mother of a neurodivergent child, and deeply interested in **neurodiversity**, **inclusive education**, and how we can design systems — from landscapes to learning environments — that are more resilient, compassionate, and adaptive.

## I’m interested in:
- Land-use change, ecological modeling & restoration
- Regenerative agroforestry and climate-smart agriculture
- Carbon and biodiversity monitoring
- Nature-based solutions (NbS) and environmental governance
- Open data, remote sensing & geospatial tools (R, QGIS, Google Earth Engine)
- Neurodiversity, giftedness, inclusive education & emotional development

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Machine Learning for Environmental Applications (R, Python, Colab)
- Landscape metrics and spatial statistics
- Applications of AI in sustainability and scientific research

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Projects and research that intersect sustainability, climate resilience, and environmental data science
- Agroforestry systems performance and landscape-scale restoration
- Methodologies to monitor ESG and SDG indicators in rural contexts
- Interdisciplinary initiatives that integrate ecology, education, and neurodiversity
